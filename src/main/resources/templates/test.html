                                        Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of
                                        those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the
                                        remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire
                                        agreement between us regarding our Service and supersede and replace any prior agreements we

                                        via Service, in our sole discretion without notice. We will not be liable if for any reason all or
                                        any part of Service is unavailable at any time or for any period. From time to time, we may

                                        Your continued use of the Platform following the posting of revised Terms means that you

                                        bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, you are no longer authorized to

                                        No waiver by Company of any term or condition set forth in Terms shall be deemed a further or
                                        continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any
                                        failure of Company to assert a right or provision under Terms shall not constitute a waiver of
                                        such right or provision.<br>
                                        If any provision of Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be
                                        invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to
                                        the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of Terms will continue in full force and
